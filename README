NOTICE: project is now being continued at https://github.com/alexbosworth/bucket - I'm not continuing with this flavor

Note: aws-s3.js is the current main line of this lib as the focus is no longer on events.

Node-S3 is a bucket focused S3 lib for Node.js. 

Make a bucket through the init method:

var myBucket = require('aws-s3').init(access_key, secret_key, bucket);

myBucket is a method. You call it to make a new request object.

Example get:

myBucket().get(myObject).success(function(obj) { console.log(obj); });

You can add callbacks via success, complete <always fired first>, and failure callbacks.

Success attempts to be a 'smart' callback and returns what you want. Complete returns the raw response.
